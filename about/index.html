    <p>As you’ve probably guessed by now, Switzerland is the dream destination for the Secret Escapes team.</p>
    <p>It’s different every time you visit, especially when you decide to skip the slopes and visit in Summer. It transforms in the seasons and you never know what to expect from town, to city, to mountain village. Every corner you cycle around and hill you walk over will show you another surprise. There isn’t a country in Europe that can get our wanderlust going like Switzerland.</p>
    <p>When you know there’s more however much you explore and you can’t wait to come back for another visit, isn’t that just the best feeling on a holiday? For us, that’s Switzerland.</p>

    <h4>Where did you grow up?</h4>
    <p>In a small town in the center of Switzerland. Surrounded by mountains and close to the Swiss Alps.</p>

    <h4>How did you get into photography?</h4>
    <p>Photography always has been a passion of mine. My father had his own photo lab at home so I grew up in the good old analog time, developing my own shots at the age of around 10. </p>
    <p>It was always a hobby and I never intended to make a living from it. I’ve been a professional photographer for more than 10 years now.</p>

    <h4>What got you into action photography?</h4>
    <p>Mountain biking always has been a great passion, so was photography. For me it was simply a combination of the two things I loved to do.</p>
    <p>If you are not riding, it's hard to see the action. You don't see the angles, you don't know what riders are capable of doing if you don't ride yourself. </p>
    <p>Sometimes you only get to the most beautiful spots riding there yourself.</p>

    <h4>What is your favorite time of day to shoot?</h4>
    <p>Like every photographer, I love the hours right after sunrise and right before sunset. </p>
    <p>Sometimes I have to shoot at bright daylight as well but with modern technology you can get decent shots even at 11 am in summer. That wouldn't have been possible in the old days with slide film.</p>

    <h4>Any tips for budding photographers?</h4>
    <p>Don't waste your time reading endless reviews about technical gear. It's not about gear. You can take great shots with a small camera. </p>
    <p>Go out there and shoot. That's the only way to improve.</p>

    <h4>What is your favorite spot is Switzerland?</h4>
    <p>The cool thing is that Switzerland is pretty small and you can do a lot of things within a couple of days. I like the Alps around Interlaken, but also Lucerne with its Lake is pretty cool. If you want to feel the city vibe, go to Zurich. </p>
    <p>I really love Zermatt. It's easy to get there, the town itself is still kinda cute with its little electronic cars and it still has that authentic feeling.</p>
    <p>Nothing beats the Matterhorn in Switzerland, it's almost impossible to take any bad pictures with it in the background.</p>
