  <p>There’s only one way to soak up all of that magnificent scenery. Hop on a train and let someone else lead the way.</p>
  <p>When it comes to exciting train journeys in Switzerland, we’re all about the Bernina Express. The 90-mile journey actually starts at the top of Italy and will take you all the way to Chur in Switzerland. The railway dates back to the 19th Century and it’s now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The gorgeous trip will take you through 55 tunnels and over 196 bridges. Don’t even think about picking up your book, you won’t want to miss a single minute of this journey.</p>

  <p>If you’d rather keep your journey to Switzerland then hop on board the Alpine Express. This is a train that’s ready for the elements and it continues running through most of the year. Your journey takes you from Zermatt to St Moritz in seven hours so you can take in the city in style.</p>
  <p>There’s another railway in Switzerland that you should know about, and that’s the historic Cog Railway. There are several cog railways in mountain regions around the world but it’s The Pilatus Railway that’s the world’s steepest with a gradient of 48%.</p>

  <p>Switzerland also has a lot of funicular railways for reaching the steepest climbs around the country. These use cables rather than cogs and they bridge the gap between cog railways and cable cars.</p>
