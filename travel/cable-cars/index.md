  <p>Switzerland’s mountains do make getting around something of a challenge. There are some peaks so high that roads and standard railway tracks just can’t tackle.</p>
  <p>For those, you’re going to need to board a cable car.</p>
  <p>Pick the CabriO and travel the 1,900 meters up Mount Stanserhorn if you want to make the most of the summer breeze. The double decker cable car is convertible and the roof comes down in good weather.</p>
  <p>Make sure you take a trip to Mittelallalin to see the world’s largest ice grotto and take a cable car from Mürren to Schilthorn for spectacular views of the Jungfrau massif.</p>

    <p>And make sure you have a go on SolarBob. Just on the outskirts of Basel, you’ll ascend a mountain by a solar powered lift and then whizz down a whole kilometre on this brilliantly fun snowless bobsled.</p>
