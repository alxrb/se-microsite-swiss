      <strong>The Eiger Trek</strong>
      <p>Don’t think you can tackle The Eiger in an afternoon. It’s one of the most challenging - and most dangerous - hikes in the world. Its North Face ascent is so tough that no one managed it until 1938. You’ll need at least a week to complete this trek and it’s best to book with an experienced tour. Expect glaciers and falling rocks and get ready for the climb of your life.</p>

    <strong>Engstligen Falls</strong>
      <p>Often the difficult hiking trails in Switzerland are tough because they take a long time, but Engstligen Falls will only take you an hour and a half. Its challenge comes from the very steep and rocky path. It doesn’t even seem possible that there could be a pathway here but it’s definitely one to be conquered.</p>

      <strong>Trift Bridge</strong>
      <p>Trift Bridge is one of the most incredible suspension bridges in the world. To reach it you’ve got one heck of a scenic adventure ahead of you through a ravine that you can only get through via cable car. The bridge itself is 100 metres high and more than 170 metres long. It overlooks the incredible 5km-long Trift Glacier. The hike is about 90 minutes each way. It might be a long way to go to cross a bridge, but what a bridge it is.</p>

      <strong>The Albula Railway Adventure Trail</strong>
      <p>We know how lovely the mountains are, but it’s nice to break the view up a little bit. As the name suggests, The Albula Railway trail follows the path of the famous Rhaetian Railway. The trail takes you across bridges, over rivers and you can hop on a train back to your starting point after you’ve finished your walk. The hike takes around two and a half hours, so it could be done with older children.</p>

      <strong>Trekking with llamas</strong>
      <p>Thankfully llama trekking has nothing to do with riding llamas, you just take them along for a pleasant walk and they’ll carry your lunch and water for you. Switzerland has a lot of llama farms so you won’t have trouble finding them, but head to Interlaken or Zurich if you or the kids are particularly keen to meet them.</p>

      <strong>The Witches Trail</strong>
      <p>If your children are into fairy tales, they’ll love the Schwarzsee region’s witches trail, which shares the story of seven Swiss legends. They’ll learn about the Gold Hole, The Butter Witch and The Snake Charmer, all in a charming walk through a beautiful region. The mostly downhill trail only takes a couple of hours and includes a flying broom zip line and, of course, there’s a witches house.</p>

    <h3>Top hiking tips</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Start early in the day and don’t underestimate how long some trails will take.</li>
      <li>Make sure someone knows which trail you’re taking, especially if you’re hiking alone.</li>
      <li>Take a picnic. Switzerland has a lot of Alpine restaurants but sometimes al fresco lunch is the best kind.</li>
      <li>Wear sunscreen. It’s easy to forget how strong the sun can be when you’re up a mountain.</li>

      <p>Nicole Hunziker has a life most of us dream of. She’s an incredible photographer with a love of all things adventurous and spends her days capturing those moments. Her much-loved Instagram account takes her followers to the most fabulous peaks and most wonderful corners of Switzerland. We caught up with her and asked her to share her top Swiss tips.</p>

    <h4>Where did you grow up?</h4>
    <p>I grew up in Langenthal, a typical Swiss town between Bern and Zurich. I inherited a love for the mountains from my parents, who went on hiking and skiing holidays with me and my sister as often as possible.</p>
    <p>That’s where I discovered the my love for the beauty of my little home country. My passion for photography has grown from this.</p>

    <h4>How did you first get into photography?</h4>
    <p>My father was always a passionate photographer. He always carried his camera with him. When I was 14 years old he surprised me by giving me one of his old cameras.</p>

    <h4>What’s your go-to place for great imagery?</h4>
    <p>There’s no better place to be than early in the morning around by Stelli Lake above Zermatt, watching the sunrise.  It’s never the same as it was the last time. It’s my personal happy place.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row"></div>

    <h4>Are you more a hike or bike kinda girl?</h4>
    <p>I’m definitely a hiking girl. I spend a lot of my summer hiking or trekking in the Swiss Alps. One of my favourite things to do is to spend the night at a Swiss Alpine Club Cabin somewhere remote in the Alps.</p>

    <h4>Where do you go for great walks?</h4>
    <p>It depends who’s with me. If I take photographers or Instagrammers with me, I lead them to my favourite photo spots. That’s often around Zermatt to get the best view of the Matterhorn. Sometimes we go to Bettmeralp to see the Aletsch glacier.</p>

    <h4>Where are your favourite places to eat in Switzerland?</h4>
    <p>My number one is Chez Vrony, Zermatt. They serve a lot of traditional Swiss dishes with an awesome view of the Matterhorn. There’s nothing better than to hike around Zermatt and relax on the terrace of Chez Vrony. Try the Vrony Burger!</p>
    <p>The second is Casa Novo in Bern. I’m working in Bern so I spend a lot of time here. In summer there’s a terrace by the river Aare where you can dine and admire the deep turquoise colour of the river.</p>
    <p>Or another good spot in Bern is Restaurant Rosengarten where you can dine with a view over the old town, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

    <div class="row"></div>

    <h4>If you had only 7 days to spend in Switzerland where would you go?</h4>
    <p>Lucerne, Zermatt, Bern and Interlaken are always a good choice. I would recommend walking a bit off the beaten tracks. Maybe visit out Fribourg instead of Bern or Thun instead of Interlaken.</p>
    <p>Switzerland is so much more than the famous spots. There are a lot of wonderful mountain lakes, restaurants with an awesome views and cabins to discover.</p>

    <h4>Any hidden gems for people coming here in the summer?</h4>
    <p>Stop at Handeck and take the funicular up to the Gelmersee, you’ll feel like you’re sitting on a roller coaster!</p>
