  <p class="lead-paragraph">Switzerland is a fantastic location for biking whatever your skill level. If you want to go hell for leather down some of the steepest peaks in the world, you won’t be short of options to brace yourself against but you’ll find loads to discover on two wheels if you just fancy a leisurely journey around the lakes, then you can take your pick.</p>

  <h3 class="row non-cap">If you’re an adrenaline junkie</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <p>It’s just you, your bike and a huge mountain. Gabriel’s top trail for biking is from Gornergrat Observatory above Zermatt down the valley to Tasch Here. Here are another couple of locations to really get your adrenaline pumping.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row row--columns-4-8-gutters row--columns-vertical-align">

      <div class="bg-image-ratio bg-image-ratio--3-2" style="background-image: url({{site.baseurl}}/img/content/lago-di-naret.jpg);"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row__column">
      <strong>Lago di Naret</strong>
      <p>While Lago di Narèt isn’t the best-known cycling trail, it’s one that serious bikers absolutely love. It’s in the south of Switzerland in the Italian-speaking part of the country and it’ll take you 1,450 metres above sea level. The climb is steep and you’re at a high altitude. The roads might be smooth but this climb is tough.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row row--columns-4-8-gutters row--columns-vertical-align">
    <div class="row__column">
      <div class="bg-image-ratio bg-image-ratio--3-2" style="background-image: url({{site.baseurl}}/img/content/lac-de-moiry.jpg);"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row__column">
    <strong>Lac de Moiry</strong>
      <p>This route might only be 89km long but it’s one of the toughest cycling challenges that you can face anywhere in the world. It’s big, it’s steep, it’s exhausting. There’s a long tunnel to whizz through, but then your reward is a the gorgeous Lac de Moiry alpine dam.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="row non-cap">If you want the best scenery</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <p>As Gabriel mentions, it’s not about going as fast as you can, there’s some brilliant scenery to look at as well. You won’t have to look far to find a beautiful view in Switzerland, but you definitely shouldn’t miss these trails.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="row row--columns-4-8-gutters row--columns-vertical-align">

    </div>
    <div class="row__column">
      <strong>St Gotthard</strong>
      <p>You’re unlikely to have St Gotthard all to yourself, such is its popularity in the cycling community. It’s one of the most famous biking trails in the world. It’s steeped in history, thanks to the old cobblestone road that dates back to the Roman times. This isn’t your average ride. It’ll take you through on of the oldest tunnels in the world and you’ll climb 2,091m above sea level.</p>

    <div class="row__column">
      <strong>Verbier</strong>
      <p>It’s one of the most popular spots in Switzerland and that’s thanks to its incredible scenery. This is where you come to experience that classic postcard-perfect Swiss view. Bright sunny valley with a backdrop of  snowcapped mountains are very much the order of the day here.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="row non-cap">If you’re out with the kids</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <p>Gabriel points out that Switzerland’s trails are very well marked which makes them perfect for biking with kids. Head to one of these top kid-friendly spots for the ultimate family experience.</p>

      <strong>Lauterbrunnen Valley</strong>
      <p>To take in gorgeous scenery without the steep climb through the alps, head to the private road which takes you from Lauterbrunnen to Stechelberg. Make sure you stop off at Trummelbach Falls along the way. The Valley of the 72 waterfalls are the world’s only glacier waterfalls that are available by lift, so they’re very child-friendly.</p>

    <div class="row__column">
      <strong>Greifensee Greifensee</strong>
      <p>Greifensee Greifensee near Zurich is an easy ride for kids. The bike trails are separate from roads and they’re clearly marked. There are no giant hills that the kids will find too tough but thanks to most of the surrounding area being part of a nature reserve, you’re still treated to beautiful lush landscapes.</p>
      <p>Try the area around nearby Pfäffikersee, too. You can swim in the lake and there’s a farm that you can visit which serves lunch.</p>

      <li>Make sure you’re on the right bike for you. Nothing too big or too small.</li>
      <li>Stop to take it all in. You’ll miss it all if you’re only thinking about racing down a hill.</li>
      <li>Don’t forget your puncture kit and make sure you pack a waterproof.</li>
      <li>Don’t forget about the altitude. Your body is going to face tougher challenges than it would riding through a flat city.</li>

      <h4> Gabriel Klouda</h4>
      <p>When it comes to biking, you want to know the best trails. So we asked biking expert Gabriel Klouda to share his favourite biking spots and give us some two-wheeled tips. He organises mountain bike trips in the Swiss Alps so when it comes to racing down a mountain (or wheeling your way to the top), he’s your guy.</p>

    <h4>How long have you been a fan of Mountain biking?</h4>
    <p>Since I’ve been about 13 years old and traded in RC cars for a mountain bike!</p>

    <h4>What’s your greatest Biking memory?</h4>
    <p>There really are way too many to point out one. Many involve descending from an isolated alpine mountain pass with a close group of friends at the end of a long day out in the mountains.</p>

    <h4>What’s your favourite part of Switzerland to bike?</h4>
    <p>The Valais region, as it has the best climate and an array of terrain ranging from high technical ridges overlooking endless glaciers and smooth twisty singletrack weaving through evergreen forests.</p>

    <h4>If you only had a couple of hours where would head to?</h4>
    <p>The Swiss Postal Bus service allows you to hop on a bus to take you up pretty much any mountain with a village. From there on you just have to find any trail sign that points down the mountain to where you came from.</p>

    <h4>If you had a full out day biking and were looking for good food where would you head for?</h4>
    <p>I would recommend enjoying the view and eating at any high alpine restaurant that serves Alpine cheese specialties, such a fondue or raclette, while sipping on one of the Valais region’s various wine varieties.</p>

    <h4>What’s your one big biking tip?</h4>
    <p>Stay relaxed on the bike and don’t crisp up trying to go fast. We’re here to enjoy the ride and many times people forget that the scenery is just as important as the trail itself.</p>
