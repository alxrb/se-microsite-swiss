  <p class="lead-paragraph">Switzerland can be a country of contrasts. Rugged mountains wrapped with smooth roads nestle beside alpine meadows full of flowers. Summer sunshine strikes the top of snow along the horizon.</p>
  <p>Those valleys are too tempting not to hike through, those forests too interesting not to explore and the mountains are just begging to be conquered.</p>
  <p>Whether you go by bike or choose to make the journey on two feet, you’re in a country that understands the urge to find out what’s over that hill.</p>
