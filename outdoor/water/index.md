<p class="row lead-paragraph">You could go for a dip in a gorgeous lake or you could take a leisurely boat trip. There are 1,484 lakes in Switzerland and thousands more smaller bodies of water so you’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to getting your feet wet. Switzerland might be landlocked, but we see that as more of a technicality.</p>

    <h3>Rhine Falls boat trip</h3>
    <p>The Rhine Falls in Switzerland is the largest waterfall in Europe and the best way to enjoy it is with a boat trip. Pick a trip that will offer you lunch and drinks if you want something leisurely, or for a little more adventure board the boat that takes you right into the middle of the falls where you can get out and climb onto the rocks.</p>

    <h3>Interlaken</h3>
    <p>Interlaken is one of the most popular holiday resort areas in Switzerland. Lakes, spas, adventure, sports - it’s like a crash course in all things Swiss. It’s looked over by three famous  mountains -  Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau - and lies between Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. If you want to get in on the action with all that Switzerland has to offer, head here.</p>

    <h3>Canyoning</h3>
    <p>There’s no way of going canyoning without getting wet, but that’s all part of the fun. You might find yourself jumping over rocks, tackling huge rappels or ziplining straight into a natural pool. There are locations all around Interlaken that suit different skill levels so you can zip, slide and leap as much as you like, even if you’ve never tried it before.</p>

    <h3>Rafts, kayaks and canoes</h3>
    <p>Kayaking or canoeing around a gorgeous lake sounds rather leisurely, and it can be, but pick your lake and trip carefully. Some of Switzerland’s lakes are hundreds of square kilometres and your arms are going to get a serious workout. Take to the River Rhone if you want to experience some rafting, when the snow melts the river gets some huge waves so it’s perfect for a fun, if very wet, adventure.</p>
