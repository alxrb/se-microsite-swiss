Sometimes you need to go to new heights to really experience a country. Take to the skies in a helicopter, hot air balloon or attached to a parachute and see Switzerland from a completely different view.

## Paragliding

Lake and mountains: two things that make paragliding an absolute breeze. Two things that Switzerland has in abundance.

Interlaken by Lake Thun is ideal for paragliders. Flanked by two lakes, you get the best experience of gliding above mountains and water. It’s one of the most incredible ways to view the areas you’ve been exploring, especially if you opt for a tandem flight.

Prices can vary depending on what bonus extras you want, but expect to pay around £140 per person. Some will take you over the lakes, others will offer you a box of chocolates to enjoy on the cog train after you’ve landed.

If you want a photo of you gliding through the air like a bird you’ll have to pay for it, but what a fabulous memento.



## Hot air ballooning

Hot air ballooning is one of the most magical ways to experience Switzerland and you won’t have to look far to find a hot air balloon to take you over the lakes and mountains.

But you will have to get up early.

The optimum wind and air conditions for balloon flights are just as the sun is coming up, which means that you’ll need to set your alarm for dawn. You’ll be treated to beautiful sunrise views and a hearty breakfast after you’ve made your descent.

You might choose to see Lake Constance or Lausanne or take an adventurous flight over the Swiss Alps.

If you’re travelling with your family you might want to go for a group option which will be more affordable. Or you can opt for a more romantic flight with a glass of champagne for a perfect proposal!

Weather conditions can sometimes cause flights to be cancelled so it’s a good idea to book your flight at the start of your trip so you have time to reschedule if you need to. Prices can vary from £200 to £1,200 so make sure you choose your trip carefully.


## Helicopter trips

Take yourself even higher still with a helicopter ride. The country is 15,942 square miles so if you want the best view, you’ve got to fly thousands of metres in the air!

You could fly over Zurich or the lakes of Geneva, but to make the most of your short trip take a ride across the Alps.

Soar across Aletsch Glacier, the largest and longest glacier in the Alps, and get unrivalled views over Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau.

Bear in mind that your short trip won’t come cheap - it’s around £200 for 20 minutes - but you’ll never forget the experience of flying over some of the most incredible mountains in the world.
