  <p>You could spend a lifetime trying to visit all of Switzerland’s lakes (and you’d have a fabulous time in doing so), but here are the water spots that will give you everything you’re looking for:</p>

<div class="row"></div>
<h3 class="row">Lake Geneva</h3>
<div class="row bg-image-ratio bg-image-ratio--21-9" style="background-image: url('{{site.baseurl}}/img/content/lake-geneva.jpg');"></div>
<p class="row">Although the southern part of Lake Geneva is actually in France, this is Switzerland’s largest lake at 580 square kilometres. Lake Neuchâtel is the largest lake wholly in Switzerland less than half its size. Geneva’s lake is such a huge draw for the beautiful and quirky city that we’ve written an entire guide to the city itself. You’re probably going to want to stay a while.</p>

<h3 class="row">Lake St Moritz</h3>
<div class="row bg-image-ratio bg-image-ratio--21-9" style="background-image: url('{{site.baseurl}}/img/content/lake-st-moritz.jpg');"></div>
<p class="row">St Moritz is a place to come for beauty and adventure. In winter when the lake freezes it’s the race course for White Turf, the incredible horse racing on ice tournament. But in Summer, it’s a fantastic spa destination thanks to the mineral springs that were discovered 3000 years ago. Take a romantic carriage ride around the lake, with the Engadin as your backdrop.</p>

<h3 class="row">Seebergsee</h3>
<div class="row bg-image-ratio bg-image-ratio--21-9" style="background-image: url('{{site.baseurl}}/img/content/seebergsee.jpg');"></div>
<p class="row">Seebergsee is the kind of lake you imagine when you think of Switzerland. It’s in the middle of a nature reserve and it’s one of those places in the world that doesn’t quite seem real. The hiking trails are all pretty easy so there’s only one thing for it: when you come here you’re going to have to do a whole lot of relaxing and soak it all in.</p>

<h3 class="row">Take a dip</h3>
<div class="row bg-image-ratio bg-image-ratio--21-9" style="background-image: url('{{site.baseurl}}/img/content/take-a-dip.jpg');"></div>
<p class="row">Lake swimming is hugely popular in Switzerland but don’t go thinking that you can jump into any bit of a lake that takes your fancy. Make sure you stick to a lakeside lido for your swim and follow the rules before you jump in. Usually you’ll pay around £5 and a little extra if you want to take advantage of a sun bed after your swim. This is Switzerland’s answer to a beach holiday.</p>
<p>Lake Lucerne is one of the best spots for lake swimming, with the finest lakeside beaches around, and you’ll find gorgeous urban pools in cities such as Zurich and Geneva.</p>
<p>If you’re visiting Interlaken, a dip in Lake Thun is usually warmer than Brienze and you’ll find Lake Lucarno absolutely charming - it’s outline is dotted with cherry trees which makes it an idyllic place for a dip.</p>
