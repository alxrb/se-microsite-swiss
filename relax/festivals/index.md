  <p>Let’s start with the big one: Montreux Jazz Festival. It’s the Jazz festival’s 50th year and will take place from 1<span class="superscript">st</span> - 16<span class="superscript">th</span> July. This is the one that draws in music’s biggest stars. Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga headed up last year’s festival, this year it’s Neil Young, Van Morrison and hundreds more world-renowned musical acts.</p>
  <p>Montreux Jazz has seen performers such as Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerald take to the stage and even if you don’t see any of the larger acts, you won’t be able to avoid live music in Montreux throughout July.</p>
  <p>Once you’ve finished in Montreux, make your way over to Lucerne for the Blue Balls Festival which runs 22 - 31 July. There are 100 acts over a week covering all genres of music.</p>

<p>At the same time, The International Street Artist festival takes over the streets of Interlaken. Head there between 24 - 26 July to see the very best in acrobats, comedians, jugglers and street performers from all over the world.</p>

<p>If the city of Zurich has caught your eye, make sure you’re there for the Summer Festival which runs for a month from 26 June. Every year the city turns into a fabulous cultural hub for art, music, dance and theatre.</p>

<p>This year there’s even more reason to head to Zurich this summer as the Zurich Festival is going to be taking place at the same time. The festival only happens once every three years and it brings 2 million people to the city each day. Head to the city over 1 - 3 July for fireworks, fairgrounds and far too much fun.</p>

<p>1 August is National Swiss Day so expect fireworks and boat trips out onto lakes. Wherever you are in Switzerland on this day, it’s a day for celebration.</p>

<p>Although Switzerland’s next yodelling festival isn’t until 2017, there are also some more unusual festivals that Switzerland celebrates.</p>

<p>Want to follow the green fairy? Switzerland was actually the birthplace of absinthe and there’s an absinthe festival held in Val de Travers every year. This year it’s only 20 June and you can expect a lot of tastings throughout the day. Don’t blame us for and strange goings on, that’s the green stuff talking.</p>

<p>If you’re really desperate to see some yodelling in action, the West Swiss Yodel Festival takes place in Saas-Fee on 1 - 3 July. There will be 2500 participants and you might even be tempted to join in yourself.</p>

<p>The International Alphorn festival takes place on 24 - 26 July. The horn is played throughout the Alps but every year in the Valais town of Nendez, 200 men don traditional dress and battle it out. 12,000 people attend the festival each year.</p>
