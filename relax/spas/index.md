After your adventures, you deserve a break. Go on, take a load off with a luxury spa day.

There’s something about the fresh Alpine air that revives and restores even the weariest of intrepid explorers. It’s not just the luxury spas and saunas that draw in the crowds, the whole of Switzerland feels like a natural spa.

For thousands of years Switzerland has understood and celebrated the idea of ‘wellness’. It’s not a fad here, it’s a way of life. The Alpine air and thermal and mineral spas are very much front of mind and there’s something about the attitude that is a little bit addictive.

In fact, the whole country seems to thrive on wellness, on feeling their best. A massage isn’t a luxury in Switzerland, it’s something that people take time out for. They put their mind and bodies before anything else, and we reckon that’s not a bad way of life to follow.

If you’re after something a little more traditional, you could opt for an open air whey bath at the foot of the Titlis. Whey’s healing properties are well known and you’ll emerge from your al fresco bath with your lungs full of fresh mountain and super soft skin.

You’ll already be getting the full on spa vibe from the moment you arrive, but if you want to make the most of the best spas in the world, you’re spoilt for choice. If we had to narrow it down to just three, we’d book into one of these for the day:

<h2 class="row">The Cambrian</h2>

This mountain spa probably has one of the most famous swimming pools in the world. The heated infinity pool looks over the Alps and it’s the perfect spot to chill out. Or you make yourself home in the Finnish spa. You’ll find us having a snooze in the sleeping room.

<h2 class="row">Villa-Honegg</h2>

Rather than booking a whole spa day, how about a spa dinner? The luxurious Villa-Honegg offers an afternoon of spa treatments followed by a glass of champagne and a gourmet four course dinner.

Secret Escapes are so excited about Villa-Honegg that we’re giving readers the chance to win a holiday here. One lucky winner will win a trip for two, including a four-night stay inclusive of breakfast and dinner. Your return business class flights are included and we’ll even throw in two Arc’teryx C-Knit Jackets from Snow & Rock so you’re ready for your SWISS adventure.

<h2 class="row">Solo Uno Wellness</h2>

This luxury spa in Basel is perfect for water babies. There’s an ice cold plunge pool (no, no, after you, we insist), a fire pool which is heated to 40 degrees and three different saltwater pools including one so salty you’ll float.
