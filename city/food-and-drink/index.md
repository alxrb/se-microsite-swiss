<p class="row">You might just be tempted to eat fondue and tartiflette for your entire trip (and who could blame you). But Geneva’s food scene will soon quickly become something you can’t wait to explore further.</p>

<div class="row">
  <h2 class="line-title"><span>Zurich</span></h2>

  <div class="row">
    <p>From cool outdoor cocktail bars that soak in the views of Lake Zurich, to gorgeous gourmet restaurants and  cute cafes, Zurich’s food scene is as cosmopolitan as the rest of the city.</p>

      <h3>Dini Mueter</h3>
      <p>As the name suggests, a visit to Dini Mueter is just like going home to see your mother. Expect home-cooked food and slices of cake that will feel like a giant hug. This cosy cafe isn’t just a place to grab a bite to eat, it’s also a concert and reading room.</p>

      <h3>Seebad Enge</h3>
      <p>During the day this swimming area of Lake Zurich is packed with sunbathers jumping in to cool off. But by night it’s a completely different story and when the lights are dimmed this spot transforms into a popular outdoor bar.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Kronenhalle</h3>
      <p>Art lovers will be in heaven at Kronenhalle and it’ll have nothing to with the fancy food. The restaurant walls are adorned with works from masters such as Chagall, Braque and Picasso. Dress up in your very finest and don’t forget to book.</p>

      <h3>Jules Verne</h3>
      <p>No cable car needed to reach the dizzy heights of the Jules Verne Panorama Bar, but you will need a ride in a glass lift. Housed at the top of the same building as the Urania observatory, this bar serves excellent cocktails with a spectacular view of Lake Zurich.</p>

      <div class="row__column">
        <h3>Café du Soleil</h3>
        <p>When in Switzerland, you absolutely must eat fondue. And you must go to Cafe du Soleil. It a small cafe and it’s incredibly popular so make sure you book in advance. Then you can fall face first into as much melted cheese as you want. Or just use the long forks, your call.</p>

        <h3>Satigny</h3>
        <p>Wine? In Switzerland? Absolutely. Geneva is home to many vineyards and while the wine is rarely exported, it’s light, very easy to drink and it’s definitely something you want to include in your holiday. Head to Satigny, where most of the vineyards are family-run operations and help yourself to a few tipples.</p>

        <h3>Izumi</h3>
        <p>You might not think that Switzerland is somewhere to seek out sushi, but in this case you’re headed to the Four Seasons hotel. Their sushi restaurant is actually on the roof terrace which means that you get a side order of gorgeous scenery with your sashimi.</p>

        <h3>Gelato Mania</h3>
        <p>A summer holiday definitely needs an ice cream or seven and there’s really only one place to go for ice cream in Geneva and that’s Gelato Mania. It’s close to Plainpalais so stop here on your way to the flea market. Just be prepared to queue.</p>
