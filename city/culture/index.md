                As you might imagine for a city that has international affairs at its heart, the culture has a global appeal.

  <h2 class="line-title"><span>Zurich</span></h2>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="lead-paragraph">There’s even more culture in Zurich to soak up after the festivals.</p>
    <p>Zurich’s festivals are going to be particularly fabulous this year, and you can read more about what not to miss in our festivals section but if your appetite for all things cultural still isn’t sated, we’ve got some more ideas for you.</p>

      <h3>Opernhaus</h3>
      <p>The Zurich Opera House opened in 1891 and it’s been a cultural focal point for the city ever since. Its focus is on ballet as well as opera but the programme has branched out to be as eclectic as the rest of the city.</p>

      <h3>The Kunsthaus</h3>
      <p>If you only have time to visit one museum in Zurich, make sure it’s the Kunsthaus. There are 4000 works of art housed here and the temporary exhibitions are well worth your time - especially when Picasso and Gauguin make an appearance.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>The Löwenbräu</h3>
      <p>If you’re looking to soak up yet more of Zurich’s art scene, then you need a trip to The Löwenbräu brewery, which houses two art galleries. First up is Kunsthalle Zurich, which is celebrated for its vibrant contemporary exhibitions. The space is also where you’ll find the Migros Museum of Contemporary Art which opens again in June with an ambitious new exhibition.</p>

      <p>While you’re on a hunt for brilliant art, join the crowds at Fraumünster Church for a peek at the windows designed by Marc Chagall.</p>

      <h3>Victoria Hall</h3>
      <p>You absolutely must pay a visit for one of the Sunday concerts. The concert hall was built in the late 19th Century and the building was dedicated to Queen Victoria. The classical music venue has one of the most incredible interiors of any music venue around the world.</p>

      <h3>Musée d’Art et d’Histoire</h3>
      <p>The Musée D’Art Et D’Histoire dates back to 1826 and it’s Geneva’s largest art museum. It will keep you busy for days so make sure it’s right at the top of your cultural itinerary. Looking for something a little more modern? Geneva has that covered, too. MAMCO is the largest contemporary art space in Switzerland and well worth a visit.</p>

      <h3>Spoutnik cinema</h3>
      <p>If film is your thing, the Spoutnik cinema offers free open air screenings throughout August and there’s an outdoor cinema at Perle du Lac during July and August. Most of the screenings will be in English with French subtitles.</p>

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>With all of that green space, music festivals in the city are an obvious choice for Geneva. Musiques En Été Festival takes place between July and August and will bring 35 open air concerts to the city over July and August.</p>
    <p>Fête De La Musique takes place from 17 to 19 June and offers venues where all sorts of bands can get up and perform, rather like a more organised open mic affair with over 500 concerts taking place in just one weekend.</p>
    <p>If you’re a rock music fan, try to catch the free open air rock music festival Festiverbant, which takes place 26 to 28 August. Rock on, Geneva. Rock on.</p>
