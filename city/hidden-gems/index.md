      <h3>Café Schober</h3>
      <p>You might think this is a tiny café, but it’s actually a cavernous patisserie that’s over a century old and sprawls over four-storeys. Each room has more elaborate decor than the last. Cake is pretty much compulsory.</p>

      <h3>The Chinese Garden</h3>
      <p>One minute you’re eating fondue and the next you’re sat in a beautiful Chinese garden. Zurich can surprise you when you’re least expecting it. This incredible garden was built in 1944 as a gift for Zurich’s sister city Kunming in the south of China. If unusual gardens are your thing, pay a visit to Zurich’s Cactus Collection for a prickly adventure.</p>

      <h3>Helmhaus</h3>
      <p>Unless you pay a visit to the Wasserkirche, you might miss Helmhaus, a contemporary art gallery that’s hidden inside. The gallery showcases works from artists and designers who live and work in Switzerland.</p>

      <h3>Giacometti murals  </h3>
      <p>These incredible murals date back 100 years and they’re one of the most spectacular sites in the city. However, they’re not in the most obvious tourist destination. You’ll find them in the entrance hall of Zurich’s police station headquarters. They’re free to visit but double check the short opening hours before you go.</p>

      <h3>Frau Gerolds Garten</h3>
      <p>Part restaurant, part bar, part urban garden and art gallery, this city spot was only supposed to be a temporary installation. Now the garden is a much-loved destination for locals and tourists who know exactly what they’re looking for.</p>

    <p class="lead-paragraph">Forget the guidebook, these are the places that you’ll be itching to tell everyone about the moment you get home. It’s hidden gems like these that you’ll never forget.</p>

      <h3>Plainpalais Flea Market</h3>
    <p>Plainpalais is home to the largest flea market in the city and oh, what a treat it is. There are hundreds of stalls to explore and pick up a bargain. Head back to the same spot the next day for the huge farmers’ market.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>The Palais Mascotte</h3>
      <p>This nightspot isn’t easy to find and it’s been around since the 19th Century. When you do find the spot (Rue de Berne 43) you’ll be treated to a dinner and cabaret show like you’ve never seen before.</p>

      <h3>Saint-Jean</h3>
      <p>A little way out of the main city is the Saint-Jean cliffs district. It’s a surprising area that’s known by locals for its views and natural beauty (so beautiful that it's been painted by Turner). A stroll along the River Rhone is reason enough for the trip but make sure you stop at the organic farmer's market on a Thursday for a bit of a picnic.</p>

      <h3>l'Horloge Fleurie</h3>
      <p class="row">Geneva is known for its watch making and the flower clock was created in 1955 to celebrate this. It’s one of the largest in the world, measuring 5 metres in diameter. The clock is seasonal too, so whatever flowers are in bloom in Switzerland when you visit will be on show.</p>
